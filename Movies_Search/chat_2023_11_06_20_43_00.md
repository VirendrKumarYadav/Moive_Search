This code snippet fetches data from the OMDb API based on a search name and page number. It then creates and appends HTML elements to display the fetched movie data.

Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The first two lines of code select the necessary DOM elements in which we will append the fetched movie data. `body` represents the parent element for the posters, and `bodyCont` represents the parent container element.

2. The `fetchAPI` function is declared, which takes `searchName` (the movie title to search for) and `pageNo` (the page number of the search result) as parameters.

3. Inside the `fetchAPI` function, we use the `fetch` function to make a GET request to the OMDb API. The `await` keyword is used to wait for the API response before proceeding. We pass the search name and page number as query parameters in the URL. The API key is also included in the URL for authentication.

4. After receiving the API response, we extract the JSON data by using the `json()` method on the `api_data` object. The `await` keyword is used again to wait for the JSON data to be parsed.

5. A loop is used
